"""
Code repository package is used as a repository of C++ classes/functions.
Those classes/functions solve problems, that are typical to most projects.
Right now, this package contains set of classes that help to export one
dimensional static arrays. For example:

C{char data[23];}

import array_1
import gil_guard
import named_tuple
import convenience
import return_range

        , gil_guard
        , convenience
        , call_policies
        , named_tuple
