Hello!

I'm pleased to announce the 0.9.0 release of Py++.

What is Py++?
=============

Py++ is an object-oriented framework for creating a code generator for
Boost.Python library.

Where is Py++?

What's new?
===========

Features
--------

* Added exposing of copy constructor, ``operator=`` and ``operator<<``.
   * ``operator=`` is exposed under "assign" name
   * ``operator<<`` is exposed under "__str__" name

* Added new call policies:
    * as_tuple
    * custom_call_policies
    * return_range

* Added an initial support for multi-module development. Now you can mark your
  declarations as ``already_exposed`` and `Py++`_ will do the rest.

* `input_c_buffer`_ - new functions transformation, which allows to pass a Python
  sequence to C++ function, instead of pair of arguments: pointer to buffer and size.

* Added ability to control generated "include" directives. Now you can ask Py++
  to include a header file, when it generates code for some declaration.

* Code generation improvements: system header files (Boost.Python or Py++ defined)
  will be included from the generated files only in case the generated code
  depends on them.

* Performance: Py++ runs 1.5 - 2 times faster.

* Py++ will generate documentation for automatically constructed properties.

* Added iteration functionality to Boost.Python Indexing Suite V2 ``std::map``
  and ``std::multimap`` containers.
