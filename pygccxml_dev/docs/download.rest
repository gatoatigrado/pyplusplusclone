GCC-XML
-------
There are few different ways to install GCC-XML on your system:

1. If you use Linux, than I am almost sure your system has "gccxml" package.
   Consider to install it using "native"(rpm, deb, portage) packaging system.

2. Another option is to install it from the source code. See `instructions`_
   provided by Brad King, the author of `GCC-XML`_. Installation from sources
   is supported for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.

3. You can use `GCC-XML`_ installer built by me, from the CVS. Go to `download page`_
   and download "gccxml-setup".
