class TreeRange:
    """This class represents a part of a tree.

    A B{simple tree range} is defined by a I{parent} node and a boolean
    flag I{recursive}. The immediate children of the parent node are
    always contained in the range (the parent itself is excluded). If
    the boolean flag is True then all grand-children of the parent
    node are also contained in the range.

    A B{compound range} is one that contains more than one simple ranges.

    The purpose of this class is to provide an iterator that yields
    parts of a declaration tree. This iteration is used when particular
    declarations are queried.
    By calling the L{union()} and L{intersect()} methods, a range
    can be created that restricts the search to particular areas of the
    tree. This can be used to exploit a priori knowledge about the filter
    function when it is known that a filter will never match a node outside
    a particular range.

    A tree range can itself be a tree of ranges. For example, consider the
    case when only the direct children of a node are contained in a range
    and you make a union() operation with a range that lies beneath that
    node. In this case, the sub range will be a children of the first range.
    A range object can only have sub ranges when its recursive flag is set
    to False, otherwise all possible sub ranges are already contained
    in that range anyway.
