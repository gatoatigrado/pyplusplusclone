Easy extending guide
====================

------------
Introduction
------------

"... Boost.Python library is designed to wrap C++ interfaces non-intrusively, so that
you should not have to change the C++ code at all in order to wrap it."

The previous statement is almost true. There are few use cases that the library
doesn't support. This guide will list some of them and will offer few possible
solutions.

-------------------
Pointer to function
-------------------

Boost.Python doesn't handle "pointer to function" functionality. You cannot pass
it as function argument or keep it, as a member variable.

The simple work-around is to use `command design pattern`_

.. _`command design pattern` : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern

------------------------------------
Problematic function arguments types
------------------------------------

C arrays
--------

Boost.Python doesn't handle ``C arrays``, the only exception are ``char*`` and
``wchar_t*``.

Consider the following function:

.. code-block:: c++

  int write( int* data, size_t size );

The technical reasons are not the only one that prevent Boost.Python to expose such
functions, there is a mental one: such interface is not intuitive for Python
developers. They expect to pass single argument. For example, built-in ``file.write``
method takes a single argument - sequence of characters.

Work-around:

  1. With small help from the developer, Py++ generates code which feets well into
     Python developer mental model. Pure virtual member functions are a special
     case, which Py++ doesn't handle right now.

  2. Use STL containers, ``std::vector<...>`` and others.


Immutable by reference
----------------------

Python defines few fundamental types as "immutable". The value of an instance of
the immutable type could not be changed after construction. Try to avoid passing
the immutable types by reference.

Immutable types:

    * ``char``
    * ``signed char``
    * ``unsigned char``
    * ``wchar_t``
    * ``short int``
    * ``short unsigned int``
    * ``bool``
    * ``int``
    * ``unsigned int``
    * ``long int``
    * ``long unsigned int``
    * ``long long int``
    * ``long long unsigned int``
    * ``float``
    * ``double``
    * ``long double``
    * ``complex double``
    * ``complex long double``
    * ``complex float``
    * ``std::string``
    * ``std::wstring``
    * C++ ``enum`` is mapped to Python ``int`` type
    * smart pointers

Work around:

    * Just don't pass them by reference :-)

    * With small help from the developer, Py++ generates code which work-arounds
      this issue, but the resulting interface is ugly.

``void*``
---------

In most cases, ``void*`` is used when a developer has to deal with a memory block. 
Python provides support for this functionality, but I still didn't find an easy and 
intuitive way to expose it. There is no work-around for this issue.

If you use ``void*`` to pass a reference to some object, than Boost.Python and Py++
support such use case.

----------------
Memory managment
----------------

* Use ``std::auto_ptr`` to transfer ownership and responsibility for an object 
  destruction. 

* The only well supported smart pointer class is ``boost::shared_ptr``.  I suggest 
  you to use it all the time, especially in cases where you want to create object 
  from Python and pass ownership to C++ code. You don't want the headache associated 
  with this task.
