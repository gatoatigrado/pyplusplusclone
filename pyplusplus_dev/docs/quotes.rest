"... If you can, use pyplusplus over pyste. I say that for ALL users of
pyste, pyplusplus is now mature enough to be useful as well as being
actively developed. It can also do quite a few tricks pyste cannot. "

  Niall Douglas, the author of  `TnFOX`_ library


"... On a related note, I highly suggest that any users out there that have
tried/used Pyste but have found it to be too lacking in power should
really give pyplusplus a try.  It has allowed me to do everything I
ever wanted to do with Pyste and couldn't and then some.  It is really
a great tool and I can't thank Roman enough for taking the time to
create it and make it available. "

  Allen Bierbaum, the author of `PyOpenSG`_ library

"... This rule based approach is amazing for maintenance, as it reduces the
turnaround for binding new code. If the new Ogre API's follow similar rules and
standards as previously defined, the same set of rules will appropriately bind
the new API without any effort on the part of the maintainers. "

" ... In general, I've really liked working with pyplusplus. I've probably spent
20-30 hours working on these bindings, and they are very close to being equivalent
to the PyOgre bindings (when I last used them). "

  Lakin Wecker, the author of `Python-OGRE`_ project

"... Py++ allows the wrappers to be "automagically" created, which means it's much
easier to keep things up to date (the maintenance on the Py++ based wrapper is
tiny compared to any other system I've used). It also allows us to wrap other
libraries fairly easily. "

  Andy Miller, a developer of `Python-OGRE`_ project

"... I tried Py++ and it indeed automatically handles the case I outlined above
concerning C-array members, and with much less tedious writing of registration
code. I also found it convenient to use to insert some other C++ code for each
of my structures that normally I wrote by hand. The API docs and examples on your
webpage were very helpful. "

  David Carpman


"... I started a few months ago to develop a set of Python bindings for
OpenCascade modeling/visualization library. After a quick tour to evaluate
different solutions, my choice lead me to Py++, which is a very convenient
tool : I was able to achieve the first release of my project only two weeks after
the project start !"

Who is using Py++?

* European Space Agency - `ReSP`_ project

  `ReSP`_ is an Open-Source hardware simulation platform targeted for
  multiprocessor systems. ReSP will provide a framework for composing a
  system by connecting components chosen from a given repository or
  developped by the designer. ReSP will provide also also a framework for
  fault injection campaigns for the analysis of the reliability level of the
  system.

  `ReSP`_ engineers are developping the simulator core in Python language for exploiting
  reflective capabilities (missing in a pure C++ environment) that can be
  exploited for connecting components in a dynamic way and for enabling
  non-intrusive fault injection activity. Components will be described in
  SystemC and TLM libraries that are high level hardware description
  languages based on C++.
