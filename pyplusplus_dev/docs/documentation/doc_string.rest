Documentation string
====================

------------
Introduction
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides a convenient way to export documentation from C++ source
files as `Python`_ `documentation string`_

---------------
API description
---------------

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  my_class = mb.class_( 'my_class' )
  my_class.documentation = '"very helpful documentation string"'
  my_class.member_function( "do_nothing" ).documentation = \
      '"This function does nothing."'

In :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` every class, which describes C++ declarations has ``documentation``
property. This property should contain valid C++ string or ``None``.

`Boost.Python`_ not always provides functionality, which exports documentation string.
In those cases, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will not generate documentation string.

Also the previous method is pretty clear, it is not practical. There should be a
better way, to complete the task. Lets take a look on
``module_builder_t.build_code_creator`` method. One of the arguments of this method
is ``doc_extractor``.


``doc_extractor`` is a callable object, which takes one argument - reference to declaration.

.. code-block:: python

  def doc_extractor( decl ):
    ...

How it could help? Every declaration has location information:

   * ``decl.location.file_name`` - absolute file name, where this declaration
     has been declared.

   * ``decl.location.line`` - line number.

So, you can go to the source file and to extract declaration from it.
:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will call ``doc_extractor`` on every exported declaration.

Now, when I think you understand what functionality :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides.
It is a time to say what functionality is missing. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` does not
provide any documentation extractor. It is not completely true. You can find
document extractor for `doxygen`_ format in ``contrib/doc_extractors`` directory.
