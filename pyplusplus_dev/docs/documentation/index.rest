Documentation
==================

------------
Help needed!
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` documentation is always under active development. It is not an easy
task to create and maintain it. I will appreciate **any help**!

How can you help?

* Lets face it: today it is not possible to use :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` without eventually
  looking into source code. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` uses Sphinx to generate documentation
  from source files. So, if you found some undocumented piece of code and you
  understand what it does, please write documentation string.

* You are reading documentation and my English cause you to scream? Please, fix
  those errors and send me new version of the document. I will integrate the
  changes.

* Do you think, that the documentation is not clear, I will be glad to improve it,
  just point me to the place.
