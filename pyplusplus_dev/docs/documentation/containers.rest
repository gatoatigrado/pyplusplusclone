C++ containers support
======================

------------
Introduction
------------

C++ has a bunch of container classes:

    * list
    * deque
    * queue
    * priority_queue
    * vector
    * stack
    * map
    * multimap
    * hash_map
    * hash_multimap
    * set
    * hash_set
    * multiset
    * hash_multiset

It is not a trivial task to expose C++ container to Python. Boost.Python has
a functionality that will help you to expose some of STL containers to `Python`_.
This functionality called - "indexing suite". If you want, you can read more
about indexing suite `here`__.

.. __ : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/indexing.html

Boost.Python, out of the box, supports only ``vector``, ``map`` and ``hash_map``
containers. In October 2003, Raoul Gough implemented support for the rest of
containers. Well, actually he did much more - he implemented new framework.
This framework provides support for almost all C++ containers and also an easy
way to add support for custom ones. You'd better read his `post`_ to
`Boost.Python`_ mailing list or :doc:`documentation <indexing_suite_v2.html>` for the new indexing suite.


Now, I am sure you have the following question: if this suite is so good, why it is not
in the main branch? The short answer is that this suite has some problems on
MSVC 6.0 compiler and there are few users, that still use that compiler.
The long answer is here:

------------------------
Py++ and indexing suites
------------------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` implements support for both indexing suites. More over, you can
freely mix indexing suites. For example you can expose ``std::vector<int>`` using
`Boost.Python`_ built-in indexing suite and ``std::map< int, std::string>`` using
Raoul Gough's indexing suite.

-----------------
How does it work?
-----------------

In both cases, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides almost "hands free" solution.
:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` keeps track of all exported functions and variables,
and if it sees that there is a usage of stl container, it exports the container.
In both cases, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` analyzes the container ``value_type``
( or in case of mapping container ``mapped_type`` ), in order to set reasonable
defaults, when it generates the code.

-------------------------------------
Indexing suite version 2 installation
-------------------------------------

None :-)

`Py++` version 1.1, introduceds few breaking changes to this indexing suite:

* the suite implements all functionality in the header files only. Few `.cpp` files
  were dropped

* header files include directive was changed from

  .. code-block:: c++

     #include "boost/python/suite/indexing/..."

  to

  .. code-block:: c++

     #include "indexing_suite/..."

The change was done to simplify the indexing suite installation and redistribution.
The gain list:

   * no need to deal with patching and rebuilding Boost

   * it is possible to use Boost libraries, which comes with your system

   * you can put the library anywhere you want - just update the include paths in
     your build script

   * it is easier to redistribute it - just include the library with your sources

   * If you are a happy :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` user:

        + :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will generate the indexing suite source files
          in the "generated code" directory, under `indexing_suite` directory.

        + :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will take care to upgrade the files

The bottom line: :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` makes C++ STL containers handling fully
transparent for its users.

-------------------
Indexing suites API
-------------------

By default, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` works with built-in indexing suite. If you want to use
indexing suite version 2, you should tell this to the ``module_builder_t.__init__``
method:

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ..., indexing_suite_version=2 )

Every declared class has ``indexing_suite`` property. If the class is an
instantiation of STL container, this property contains reference to an instance
of ``indexing_suite1_t`` or ``indexing_suite2_t`` class.


How does :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` know, that a class represents STL container instantiation?
Well, it uses ``pygccxml.declarations.container_traits`` to find out this.
``pygccxml.declarations.container_traits`` class, provides all functionality
needed to identify container and to find out its ``value_type``
( ``mapped_type`` ).


Built-in indexing suite API
---------------------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` defines ``indexing_suite1_t`` class. This class allows configure
any detail of generated code:

* ``no_proxy`` - a boolean, if ``value_type`` is one of the the following types

  * fundamental type

  * enumeration

  * std::string or std::wstring

  * boost::shared_ptr<?>

  then, ``no_proxy`` will be set to ``True``, otherwise to ``False``.

* ``derived_policies`` - a string, that will be added as is to generated code

* ``element_type`` - is a reference to container ``value_type`` or ``mapped_type``.


Indexing suite version 2 API
----------------------------------

In this case there is no single place, where you can configure exported container
functionality. Please take a look on the following C++ code:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct item{
      ...
  private:
      bool operator==( const item& ) const;
      bool operator<( const item& ) const;
  };

  struct my_data{
      std::vector<item> items;
      std::map< std::string, item > name2item_mapping;
  };


:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` declarations tree will contains ``item``, ``my_data``,
``vector<item>`` and ``map<string,item>`` class declarations.

If ``value_type`` does not support "equal" or "less than" functionality, sort
and search functionality could not be exported.

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` class declaration has two properties: ``equality_comparable`` and
``less_than_comparable``. The value of those properties is calculated on first
invocation. If :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` can find ``operator==``, that works on ``value_type``,
then, ``equality_comparable`` property value will be set to ``True``, otherwise
to ``False``. Same process is applied on ``less_than_comparable`` property.

In our case, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will set both properties to ``False``, thus sort and
search functionality will not be exported.

It is the time to introduce ``indexing_suite2_t`` class:

* ``container_class`` - read only property, returns reference to container class
  declaration

* ``container_traits`` - read only property, returns reference to the relevant
  container traits class. Container traits classes are defined in
  ``pygccxml.declarations`` package.

* ``element_type`` - is a reference to container ``value_type`` or ``mapped_type``.

* ``call_policies`` - read/write property, in near future I will add code to
  :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` that will analyze container ``value_type`` and will decide about
  default call policies. Just an example: for non-copy constructable classes
  ``call_policies`` should be set to ``return_internal_reference``.

* ``[disable|enable]_method`` - new indexing suite, allows to configure
  functionality exported to Python, using simple bitwise operations on predefined
  flags. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` allows you to specify what methods you want to disable
  or enable. ``indexing_suite2_t.METHODS`` contains names of all supported methods.

* ``[disable|enable]_methods_group`` - almost same as above, but allows you
  to specify what group of methods you want to disable or enable.
  ``indexing_suite2_t.METHOD_GROUPS`` contains names of all supported groups.

Small tips/hints
----------------

1. If you set ``equality_comparable`` or ``less_than_comparable`` to ``False``.
   The indexing suite will disable relevant functionality. You don't have
   explicitly to disable method or methods group.

2. The documentation of new indexing suite contains few small mistakes.
   I hope, I will have time to fix them. Any way, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` generates
   correct code.
