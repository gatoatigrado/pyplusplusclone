Py++ warnings

Introduction
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` has been created with few goals in mind:

* to allow users create `Python`_ bindings for large projects using the `Boost.Python`_
  library

* to minimize maintenance time

* to serve as a user's guide for `Boost.Python`_ library


Those goals all have something in common. In order to achieve them, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` must
give useful feedback to the user. Because :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` understands the declarations
it exports, it can scan declarations for potential problems, report them and in
some cases provide hints about how to resolve the problem. Few examples:

*
  .. code-block:: c++

     struct Y{ ... };

  .. code-block:: c++

     struct X{
         ...
         virtual Y& do_smth();
     };

  Member function ``do_smth`` cannot be overridden in Python because ... .

*
  .. code-block:: c++

     struct window{
         ...
         void get_size( int& height, int& width ) const;
     };

  Member function ``get_size`` can be exposed to Python, but it will not be callable because ... .

* In order to expose free/member function that takes more than 10 arguments user
  should define ``BOOST_PYTHON_MAX_ARITY`` macro.

*
  .. code-block:: c++

     struct X{
         ...
     };

     void do_smth( X x );

  If you expose ``do_smth`` function and don't expose struct ``X``, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`
  will tell you that struct ``X`` is used in exported declaration, but was not
  exposed.

For these problems and many other :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` gives a nice explanation
and sometimes a link to the relevant information on the Internet.

I don't know what about you, but I found these messages pretty useful. They allow
me to deliver Python bindings with higher quality.

-------------
How it works?
-------------

In previous paragraph, I described some pretty useful functionality but what should you
do to enable it? - *Nothing!* By default, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` only prints the
important messages to ``stdout``. More over, it prints them only for to be exposed 
declarations.

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` uses the python  `logging`_ package to write all user messages. By
default, messages with ``DEBUG`` level will be skipped, all other messages will
be reported.

--------
Warnings
--------

Example of the warning:
::

  WARNING: containers::item_t [struct]
  > warning W1020: Py++ will generate class wrapper - hand written code
  > should be added to the wrapper class

Almost every warning reported by :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` consists from 3 parts:

* description of the declaration it refers to: "containers::item_t [struct]"

* warning unique identifier: "W1020"

* short explanation of the problem: "Py++ will generate class wrapper - hand
  written code should be added to the wrapper class"

API Description
---------------

How to disable warning(s)?
--------------------------

Every warning has unique identifier. In the example I gave it was ``W1020``.

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import messages
   from pyplusplus import module_builder

   mb = module_builder.module_builder_t( ... )
   xyz = mb.class_( XYZ )
   xyz.disable_warnings( messages.W1020 )

It is also possible to disable warnings for all declarations. ``pyplusplus.messages``
package defines ``DISABLE_MESSAGES`` variable. This variable( ``list`` ) keeps
all warnings, which should not be reported. Use ``messages.disable`` function to
edit it:

.. code-block:: python

   messages.disable( messages.W1020 )
   
   #you also can disable warnings reporting at all:
   messages.disable( *messages.all_warning_msgs )

Logging API
-----------

If you are here, it probably means that you are not pleased with default configuration
and want to change it, right?

1. If you simply want to change the logging message level:

   .. code-block:: python

     import logging
     from pyplusplus import module_builder

   .. code-block:: python

     module_builder.set_logger_level( logging.DEBUG )


2. But what if you want to disable some messages and leave others? This is also possible.
   :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` and :doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` do not use a single logger. Almost every internal
   package has its own logger. So you can enable one logger and disable another one.

   The :doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` package defines all loggers in the ``pygccxml.utils`` package.

   The :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` package defines all loggers in the ``pyplusplus._logging_`` package.

   Both packages define a ``loggers`` class. Those classes keep references to
   different loggers. The ``loggers`` classes look very similar to the following class:

   .. code-block:: python

      import logging #standard Python package

      def _create_logger_( name ):
          logger = logging.getLogger(name)
          ...
          return logger

      class loggers:
           file_writer = _create_logger_( 'pyplusplus.file_writer' )
           declarations = _create_logger_( 'pyplusplus.declarations' )
           module_builder = _create_logger_( 'pyplusplus.module_builder' )
           root = logging.getLogger( 'pyplusplus' )
           all = [ root, file_writer, module_builder, declarations ]

   You can use these references in the ``logging`` package to complete
   your task of adjusting individual loggers.

   One more thing, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` automatically splits long message, where line
   length defaults to 70 characters. Thus it is very convenient to read them on your screen.
   If you want to use different tools to monitor those messages, consider to use
   standard `Formatter`_ class, instead of ``multi_line_formatter_t`` one.


Declarations API
----------------

Every declaration class has the following methods:

* ``why_not_exportable( self )``

  This method explains why a declaration could not be exported. The return value
  is a string or ``None``. ``None`` is returned if the declaration is exportable.

  Property ``exportable`` will be set to ``True`` if declaration is exportable,
  and to ``False`` otherwise.

* ``readme( self )``

  This method gives you access to all tips/hints/warnings :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` has about
  the declaration. This methods returns a list of strings. If the declaration is
  not exportable, than first message within the list is an explanation, why it
  is not exportable.
