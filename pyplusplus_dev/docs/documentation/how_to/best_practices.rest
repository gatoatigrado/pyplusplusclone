Introduction
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` has reach interface and a lot of functionality. Sometimes reach
interface helps, but sometimes it can confuse. This document will describe how
effectively to use :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>`.

Big projects
------------

Definition
----------

First of all, let me to define "big project". "Big project" is a project with
few hundred of header files. :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` was born to create `Python`_ bindings
for such projects. If you take a look :doc:`here <../../quotes>` you will find few such projects.

Tips
----

* Create one header file, which will include all project header files.

  Doing it this way makes it so `GCC-XML`_ is only called once and it reduces the
  overhead that would occur if you pass `GCC-XML`_ all the files individually.
  Namely `GCC-XML`_ would have to run hundreds of times and each call would
  actually end up including quite a bit of common code anyway. This way takes a
  `GCC-XML`_ processing time from multiple hours with gigabytes of caches to a
  couple minutes with a reasonable cache size.

  You can read more about different caches supported by :doc:`pygccxml <../../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` 
  :doc:`here <../../../pygccxml/design>`.
  ``module_builder_t.__init__`` method takes reference to an instance of cache
  class or ``None``:

  .. code-block:: python

    from module_builder import *
    mb = module_builder_t( ..., cache=file_cache_t( <<<path to project cache file>>> ), ... )

* Single header file, will also improve performance compiling the generated bindings.

  When :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` generated the bindings, you have a lot of .cpp files to
  compile. The project you are working on is big. I am sure it takes a lot of
  time to compile projects that depend on it. Generated code also depend on it,
  more over this code contains a lot of template instantiations. So it could
  take a great deal of time to compile it. Allen Bierbaum investigated this
  problem. He found out that most of the time is really spent processing all the
  headers, templates, macros from the project and from the boost library. So he
  come to conclusion, that in order to improve compilation speed, user should
  be able to control( to be able to generate ) precompiled header file. He
  implemented an initial version of the functionality. After small discussion,
  we agreed on the following interface:

  .. code-block:: python

    class module_builder_t( ... ):
        ...
        def split_module( self, directory_path, huge_classes=None, precompiled_header=None ):
            ...

  ``precompiled_header`` argument could be ``None`` or string, that contains
  name of precompiled header file, which will be created in the directory.
  :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will add to it header files from `Boost.Python`_ library and
  your header files.

  What is ``huge_classes`` argument for? ``huge_classes`` could be ``None`` or
  list of references to class declarations. It is there to provide a solution to
  `this error`_. :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will automatically split generated code for the
  huge classes to few files:

  .. code-block:: python

    mb = module_builder_t( ... )
    ...
    my_big_class = mb.class_( my_big_class )
    mb.split_module( ..., huge_classes=[my_big_class], ... )

  * **Caveats**
   
    Consider the following file layout:
    ::

      boost/
        date_time/
          ptime.hpp
          time_duration.hpp
          date_time.hpp //main header, which include all other header files

    Py++ currently does not handle relative paths as input very well, so it is 
    recommended that you use "os.path.abspath()" to transform the header file to 
    be processed into an absolute path:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      #the following code will expose nothing
      mb = module_builder( [ 'date_time/date_time.hpp' ], ... ) 

      #while this one will work as expected
      import os
      mb = module_builder( [ os.path.abspath('date_time/date_time.hpp') ], ... ) 

.. _`this error` : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html#c1204

* Keep the declaration tree small.

  When parsing the header files to build the declaration tree, there will also
  be the occasional "junk" declaration inside the tree that is not relevant to
  the bindings you want to generate. These extra declarations come from header
  files that were included somewhere in the header files that you were actually
  parsing (e.g. if that library uses the STL or OpenGL or other system headers
  then the final declaration tree will contain those declarations, too).
  It can happen that the majority of declarations in your declaration tree are
  such "junk" declarations that are not required for generating your bindings
  and that just slow down the generation process (reading the declaration cache
  and doing queries will take longer).

  To speed up your generation process you might want to consider making the
  declaration tree as small as possible and only store those declarations that
  somehow have an influence on the bindings. Ideally, this is done as early
  as possible and luckily gccxml provides an option that allows you to reduce
  the number of declarations that it will store in the output XML file. You can
  specify one or more declarations using the ``-fxml-start`` option and only
  those sub-tree starting at the specified declarations will be written. For
  example, if you specify the name of a particular class, only this class
  and all its members will get written. Or if your project already uses
  a dedicated namespace you can simply use this namespace as a starting point
  and all declarations stemming from system headers will be ignored (except
  for those declarations that are actually used within your library).

  In the ``pygccxml`` package you can set the value for the ``-fxml-start``
  option using the ``start_with_declarations`` attribute of the
  ``pygccxml.parser.config_t`` object that you are passing to the parser.

* Use :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` repository of generated files md5 sum.

  :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` is able to store md5 sum of generated files in a file. Next time you 
  will generate code, :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will compare generated file content against the sum,
  instead of loading the content of the previously generated file from the disk 
  and comparing against it. 
    
  .. code-block:: python

    mb = module_builder_t( ... )
    ...
    my_big_class = mb.class_( my_big_class )
    mb.split_module( ..., use_files_sum_repository=True )

  :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will generate file named "<your module name>.md5.sum" in the directory
  it will generate all the files.
  
  Enabling this functionality should give you 10-15% of performance boost.
  
  * **Caveats**
  
    If you changed manually some of the files - don't forget to delete the relevant
    line from "md5.sum" file. You can also delete the whole file. If the file is
    missing, :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will use old plain method of comparing content of the files.
    It will not re-write "unchanged" files and you will not be forced to recompile 
    the whole project.
