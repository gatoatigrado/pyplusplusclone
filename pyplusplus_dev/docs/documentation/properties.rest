Introduction
------------

`Boost.Python`_ allows users to specify class properties. You can read about
this functionality in the `tutorials`_  or in the `reference manual`_. Since
version 0.8.2 :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides a convenient API to specify class properties.

.. _`tutorials` : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/exposing.html#python.class_properties
.. _`reference manual` : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/class.html

-------------
Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: c++

  struct number{
      ...
      float value() const;
      void  set_value( float );
      ...
  private:
      float m_value;
  }

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  number = mb.class_( 'number' )
  number.add_property( 'ro_value', number.member_function( 'value' ) )
  number.add_property( 'value'
                       , number.member_function( 'value' )
                       , number.member_function( 'set_value' ) )

This is rather the hard way to add properties to the class. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` comes with
built-in algorithm, which automatically recognizes properties and adds them to the
class:

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  number = mb.class_( 'number' )
  number.add_properties( exclude_accessors=False ) #accessors will be exposed

Small advise to you: try ``add_properties`` algorithm first, it should work.
If it doesn't than:

* Please, bring your use case to the developers of :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`, so we could improve
  it

* Switch to the ``add_property`` method for a while

-------------
Call policies
-------------

Consider the following use case:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct nested{ ... };

.. code-block:: c++

  struct data{
      ...
      const nested& get_nested() const
      { return m_nested; }
      ...
  private:
      nested m_nested;
  };

In order to expose ``get_nested`` member function you have to specify its
`call policies`_. Same precondition holds for exposing member function as
property:

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  get_nested = mb.member_function( 'get_nested' )
  get_nested.call_policies = call_policies.return_internal_reference()
  mb.class_( 'data' ).add_properties()

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will take the `call policies`_ information from the relevant accessor.

Property recognition algorithm
------------------------------

Description
-----------

In general the algorithm is very simple. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` understands few coding
conventions. It is aware of few widely used get\\set prefixes. It scans the class
and its base classes for accessors and after this it tries to match between
"get" and "set" accessors. If there is "set" accessors, but there is no "get"
accessor, property will not be constructed. At least one accessor should belong
to the class. In new property will override an existing exposed declarations
property will not be created and warning will be written.

Find accessors
--------------

This part of the algorithm is responsible for finding all functions, which meet
get\\set accessors criteria.

"get" accessor criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. It does not have arguments.
2. It has return other than ``void``.
3. It does not modify the instance - has ``const`` attribute.
4. It does not have an overload.

"set" accessor criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. It has only 1 argument.
2. Its return type is ``void``.
3. It do modify the instance - doesn't have ``const`` attribute.

There are also few rules that applies on both accessor types:

1. Accessor should be **included**.
2. Accessor should be "public".
3. It should not be static.
4. It should not be pure virtual.


Recognize property
------------------

This part of the algorithm is responsible to recognize the pair of "get" and "set"
accessors, which constructs the property. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` does it by analyzing name and
type of the accessors.

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` understands the following coding conventions:

* lowercase_with_underscores
* UpperCamel
* lowCamel

It is also aware of few common prefixes for set\\get accessors: get, is, has, set,
<<empty prefix for get accessor>>.

Documentation
-------------
You can use ``doc`` attribute to specify the property documentation. If you
don't, than :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will construct documentation, which will describe from what
functions this property was built from.
