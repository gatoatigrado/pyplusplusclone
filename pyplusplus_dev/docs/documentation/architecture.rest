Introduction

This document will describe an architecture behind :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`.

---------------------------
Py++ & pygccxml integration
---------------------------

C++
---

C++ is very powerful programming language. The power brings complexity. It is
not an easy task to parse C++ source files and to create in memory representation
of declarations tree. The declarations tree is worth nothing, if a user is not
able to explorer it, to run queries against it or to find out traits of a
declaration or a type.

On the earlier stage of the development, I realized, that all this functionality
does not belong to code generator and should be implemented out side of it.
:doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` project was born. :doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` made the code generator to be smaller
and C++ parser independent. It provides the following services:

* definition of classes, that describe C++ declaration and types, and their
  analyzers ( type traits )

* C++ source files parsing and caching functionality


:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` uses those services to:

* extract declarations from source files and to provide powerful query interface

* find out a declaration default configuration:

  * call policies for functions

  * indexing suite parameters

  * generate warnings/hints

  * ...


Integration details
-------------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` uses different approaches to expose these services to the user.

Parsing integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides it's own "API" to configure :doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` parsing services. The
"API" I am talking about, is arguments to ``module_builder.__init__`` method.
We think, that exposing those services via :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` simplifies its usage.


Declarations tree integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Declarations tree API consists from 3 parts:

* interface definition:

  * ``declaration_t`` and all classes that derive from it

  * ``type_t`` and all classes that derive from it

* type traits

* query engine API


The user should be familiar with these parts and relevant API. In my opinion,
wrapping or hiding the API will not provide an additional value. The interface
of all those services is pretty simple and well polished.

Before I explain how these services are integrated, take a look on the following source
code:

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  
  details = mb.namespace( 'details' )
  details.exclude()
  
  my_class = mb.class_( 'my_class' )
  my_class.rename("MyClass")


What you see here, is a common pattern, that will appear in all projects, that
use :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`:

* find the declaration(s)

* give the instruction(s) to the code generator engine

What is the point of this example? From the user point of view it is perfectly
good, it makes a lot of sense to configure the code generation engine, using
the declarations tree. How does :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` add missing functionality to
``pygccxml.declarations`` classes? There were few possible solutions to the
problem. The following one was implemented:

1. ``pygccxml.parser`` package interface was extended. Instead of creating
   a concrete instance of declaration classes, ``pygccxml.parser`` package uses
   a factory.

2. ``pyplusplus.decl_wrappers`` package defines classes, which derive from
   ``pygccxml.declarations`` classes and defines the factory.

The implemented solution is not the simplest one, but it provides an additional
value to the project:

* the code generation engine configuration and declarations tree are tightly
  coupled

* the functionality provided by ``pygccxml.declarations`` and ``pygccxml.parser``
  packages is available for ``pyplusplus.decl_wrappers`` classes

* classes defined in ``pyplusplus.decl_wrappers`` package implement the following
  functionality:

  * setting reasonable defaults for the code generation engine( call policies,
    indexing suite, ... )

  * provides user with additional information( warnings and hints )

* as a bonus, :doc:`pygccxml <../../pygccxml/pygccxml>` remained to be stand-alone project

----------------------
Code generation engine
----------------------

Code generation for `Boost.Python`_ library is a difficult process. There are two
different problems the engine should solve:

.. _`divide and conquer` : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm

* What code should be created in order to export a declaration?

* How it should be written to files?

  Remember, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` is targeting big projects. It cannot generate all code
  in one file - this will not work, not at all.

``Code creators`` and file writers provides solution for both problems.

``Code creators``
-----------------

Do you know how many ways exist to export member function? If you will try to
answer the question, consider the following function characteristics and their mix:

* virtuality( non virtual, virtual or pure virtual )

* access level( public, protected or private )

* static\\non static

* overloads

As you see, there are a lot of use cases. How do ``code creators`` solve the problem?

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

``Code creator`` is an in-memory fragment of a C++ code.

Also, ``code creator`` can represent an arbitrary C++ code, in practice it
represents logically complete block.

Example of ``code creators``:

* ``code_creators.enum_t`` generates registration code for an enumeration

* ``code_creators.mem_fun_pv_t`` generates registration code for public, pure
  virtual function

* ``code_creators.mem_fun_pv_wrapper_t`` generates declaration code for public,
  pure virtual function

* ``code_creators.include_t`` generates include directives

* ``code_creators.custom_text_t`` adds some custom( read user ) text\\code to
  the generated code

There are primary two groups of ``code creators``: declaration based and others.

Declaration based ``code creator`` keeps reference to the declaration (
``pyplusplus.decl_wrapper.*`` class instance ). During code generation process,
it reads its settings( the code generation engine instructions ) from the
declaration. Declaration based ``code creators`` also divided into two groups.
The first group creates registration code, where the second one creates
wrapper\\helper declaration code.

I will reuse `this example`__, from `Boost.Python`_ tutorials.

.. __ : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/exposing.html#python.virtual_functions_with_default_implementations

1. ``BaseWrap::f``, ``BaseWrap::default_f`` - declaration code is created by
   ``code_creators.mem_fun_v_wrapper_t``

2. ``f`` registration code is created by ``code_creators.mem_fun_v_t``. This
   code creator also keeps reference to the relevant instance of
   ``code_creators.mem_fun_v_wrapper_t`` class.

Composite ``code creator`` is a creator, which contains other creators. Composite
``code creator`` embeds the code, created by internal ``code creators``, within
the code it creates. For example:

* ``code_creators.class_t``:

  First of all it creates class registration code ( ``class_<...>`` ), after
  this it appends to it code generated by internal creators.

* ``code_creators.module_body_t``:

  Here is "cut & paste" of the relevant code from the source file:

  .. code-block:: python

    def _create_impl(self):
        result = []
        result.append( "BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(%s){" % self.name )
        result.append( compound.compound_t.create_internal_code( self.creators ) )
        result.append( "}" )
        return os.linesep.join( result )


``Code creators tree``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``code_creators.module_t`` class is a top level ``code creator``. Take a look on
the following possible "snapshot" of the ``code creators tree``:

::

  <module_t ...>
      <license_t ...>
      <include_t ...>
      <include_t ...>
      <class_wrapper_t ...>
          <mem_fun_v_wrapper_t ...>
          <mem_fun_v_wrapper_t ...>
      <module_body_t ...>
          <enum_t ...>
          <class_t ...>
              <mem_fun_v_t ...>
              <member_variable_t ...>
          <free_function_t ...>
          <...>

You can think about ``code creators tree`` as some kind of `AST`_.

.. _`AST`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree

``Code creators tree`` construction
-----------------------------------

``pyplusplus.creators_factory`` package is responsible for the tree construction.
``pyplusplus.creators_factory.creator_t`` is the main class of the package. It
creates the tree in few steps:

1. It builds set of exposed declarations.
2. It sort the set. `Boost.Python`_ has few rules, that forces the user to export
   a declaration before another one.
3. It creates ``code creators`` and put them into the right place within the tree.
4. If a declaration describes C++ class, it applies these steps to it.

Another responsibility of ``creator_t`` class, is to analyze declarations and
their dependency graphs. As a result, this class can:

* find out a class ``HeldType``

* find out smart pointers conversion, which should be registered

* find out STD containers, which should be exported

* warn user, if some declaration is not exported and it used somewhere in
  exported declarations ( **not implemented** )


``File writers``
----------------

``File writers`` classes are responsible for writing ``code creators tree`` into
the files. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` implements the following strategies of writing ``code creators tree``
into files:

* single file

* multiple files - provides a solution to `compilation time and memory usage problem`_

  .. _`compilation time and memory usage problem` : http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html#slow_compilation

* multiple files, with huge classes are written into multiple files - provides a
  solution for `compiler limit`_ problem.

  .. _`compiler limit` : http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html#c1204

The more sophisticated approach, the better understanding of ``code creators``
is required from the ``file writers``.

``module_builder`` package
--------------------------

This package provides an interface to all code generator engine services.

Conclusion

It safe to use :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` for big and small projects!
