Inserting code
==============

------------
Introduction
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` is not a magician! Sometimes there is a need to add code to
generated file(s). This document will describe how you can insert your code to
almost any place.

---------------------
Insert code to module
---------------------

Almost every ``Boost.Python`` module has the following structure:

.. code-block:: c++

  //declarations code
  ...
  BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(X)
  {
    //registrations code
    ...
  }

Using ``module_builder_t`` you can add code to declaration and registration
sections. More over you can add the code to head or tail of the section.
``module_builder_t`` class provides API, which will help you to complete the task:

* ``add_declaration_code( self, code, tail=True )``

  This function will add a code to the declaration section. If you want to add
  the code to the head of the section, pass ``tail=False`` to the method.

* ``add_registration_code( self, code, tail=True )``

  This function will add a code to the registration section. If you want to add
  the code to the head of the section, pass ``tail=False`` to the method.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  mb.build_code_creator( ... )
  mb.add_declaration_code( '//just a comment' )
  mb.add_registration_code( '//another comment', False ) #adding code to the head


--------------------
Insert code to class
--------------------

``class_t`` declaration defines few methods, which add user code to the generated one.
Lets take a look on the following use case:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct window_t{
      ...
      void get_size( int& height, int& width ) const;
      ...
  };

``int`` is immutable type in Python. So you cannot expose ``get_size`` member
function as is. You need to create a wrapper and expose it.

In the near future :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will eliminate the need of creating hand
written wrapper for this use case.

.. code-block:: c++

  boost::python::tuple get_window_size( const window_t& win ){
      int h(0), w(0);
      win.get_size( h, w );
      return boost::python::make_tuple( h, w );
  }

Now you have to register it:

.. code-block:: c++

  using boost::python;
  class_< window_t >( ... )
      .def( "get_size", &::get_window_size )
      ...
  ;

How it could be achieved with :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`? Class declaration, has also two
functions:

* ``add_declaration_code( self, code )``

  This method will add the code to the declaration section within the module.

  If you split your module to few files, :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will add this code to the
  "cpp" file, class registration code will be written in.

  Attention: there is no defined order between wrapper code and declaration section
  code. If you have dependencies between code from declaration section and class
  wrapper, consider to move declaration code to class wrapper.

* ``add_registration_code( self, code, works_on_instance=True )``

  This method will add the code to the registration section of the class.

  What is ``works_on_instance`` argument for? In our case, we added new method
  to the class. The first argument of the call will be ``self``.

  .. code-block:: python

    #From Python user can call this method like this:
    win = window_t( )
    height, width = win.get_size()

  If you will pass ``works_on_instance=False`` the following code will be generated:

  .. code-block:: c++

    {
        class_< window_t > window_exporter( "window_t" );
        scope window_scope( window_exporter );
        ...
        def( "get_size", &::get_window_size );
    }

  And in this case, user will be forced to pass reference to ``window_t`` object:

  .. code-block:: c++

    win = window_t()
    height, width = window_t.get_size( win )

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  window = mb.class_( 'window_t' )
  window.add_declaration_code( get_window_size definition )
  window.add_registration_code( 'def( "get_size", &::get_window_size )' )
  #Py++ will add ';' if needed

----------------------------
Insert code to class wrapper
----------------------------

There are use cases, when you have to add code to `class wrapper`_. Please take a
look on the following thread: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/c++-sig/2006-June/010791.html .


.. _`class wrapper` : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/exposing.html#python.class_virtual_functions


The short description is the following: there are classes with parent/child relationship.
Parent keeps child class instances using raw pointer. When parent die, it also
destroys children classes. It is not an option to switch to ``boost::shared_ptr``.

The solution Niall Douglas found was to implement small lifetime manager. For
this solution he needed:

* to add to every constructor of class wrapper some code that registers the
  instance of the class within the manager

* to add to destructor of class wrapper some code, that will destroy the instance
  if needed.

* to add to class wrapper new variable

Solution
--------

.. code-block:: python

  def inject_code( cls ):
      constructors = cls.constructors()
      constructors.body = class instance registration code
      #if you need to add code to default or copy constructor only
      #than you can you the following shortcuts
      cls.null_constructor_body = <<<your code>>>
      cls.copy_constructor_body = <<<your code>>>
      #which will update the appropriate ``body`` property.
	  
	  #If you want to add code to the class destructor,
	  #use ``add_destructor_code`` method
	  cls.add_destructor_code( <<<your code>>> )
      
	  #If you need to add new class variables:		   
      cls.add_wrapper_code( <<<variable declaration>>> )

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  for cls in mb.classes( <<<relevant classes only>>> ):
    inject_code( cls )

Header files
------------

Now, when you know how to add your code to a generated one, I think you also should
now how to add your own set of include directives to the generated files. There
are few ways to do this.

1. The easiest and the most effective one - tell to :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` that generated code
   for the declaration should include additional files:

   .. code-block:: python

     mb = module_builder_t( ... )
     my_class = mb.class_( ... )
     my_class.include_files.append( "vector" )

   Every declaration has ``include_files`` property. This is a list of header files,
   you want to include from the generated file(s).

2. Other approach is a little bit low level, but it allows you to add your header
   files to every generated file:

   .. code-block:: python

     mb = module_builder_t( ... )
     ...
     mb.build_code_creator( ... )
     mb.code_creator.add_include( "iostream" )

   You can also replace all (to be) generated header files with your own set:

   .. code-block:: python

     mb.code_creator.replace_included_headers( ["stdafx.h"] )

Of course you can, and may be should, use both approaches.

I suggest you to spend some time and to tweak :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` to generate source code
with as little as possible include directives. This will save you huge amount of
time later.
