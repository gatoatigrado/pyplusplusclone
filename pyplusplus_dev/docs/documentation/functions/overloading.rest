Overloading
===========

Introduction
------------

Things get a little bit complex, when you have to export overloaded functions.
In general the solution is to explicitly say to compiler what function you
want to export, by specifying its type. Before we proceed, please take a look
on the following class:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct X
  {
      bool f(int a)
      {
          return true;
      }

      bool f(int a, double b)
      {
          return true;
      }

      bool f(int a, double b, char c)
      {
          return true;
      }
  };

This class has been taken from `Boost.Python`_ `tutorials`__.

.. __ : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/functions.html#python.overloading

There are few approaches, which you can use in order to export the functions.

-------------------
Do nothing approach
-------------------

I am sure you will like "do nothing" approach. :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` recognize that you want to
export an overloaded function and will generate the right code:

.. code-block:: c++

  namespace bp = boost::python;

  BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(pyplusplus){
    bp::class_< X >( "X" )
        .def(
            "f"
            , (bool ( ::X::* )( int ) )( &::X::f )
            , ( bp::arg("a") ) )
        .def(
            "f"
            , (bool ( ::X::* )( int,double ) )( &::X::f )
            , ( bp::arg("a"), bp::arg("b") ) )
        .def(
            "f"
            , (bool ( ::X::* )( int,double,char ) )( &::X::f )
            , ( bp::arg("a"), bp::arg("b"), bp::arg("c") ) );
  }

--------------------------------
"create_with_signature" approach
--------------------------------

Well, while previous approach is very attractive it does not work in all cases
and have a weakness.

Overloaded template function
----------------------------

I am sure you already know the following fact, but still I want to remind it:

* `GCC-XML`_ doesn't report about un-instantiated templates

It is very important to understand it. Lets take a look on the following source code:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct Y{

      void do_smth( int );

      template< class T>
      void do_smth( T t );

  };

If you didn't instantiate( use ) ``do_smth`` member function, than `GCC-XML`_
will not report it. As a result, :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` will not be aware of the fact that
``do_smth`` is an overloaded function. To make the long story short, the generated
code will not compile. You have to instruct :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` to generate code, which
contains function type:

.. code-block:: python

  from pyplusplus import module_builder

  mb = module_builder.module_builder_t( ... )
  y = mb.class_( 'Y' )
  y.member_function( 'do_smth' ).create_with_signature = True
  #------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` class, which describes C++ function\\operator has ``create_with_signature``
property. You have to set it to ``True``. Default value of the property is
computed. If the exported function is overloaded, then its value is ``True``
otherwise it will be ``False``.

Do nothing approach weakness
----------------------------

Code modification - the weakness of the "do nothing" approach. We live in the
dynamic world. You can create bindings for a project, but a month letter, the
project developers will add a new function to the exported class. Lets assume
that the new function will introduce overloading. If ``create_with_signature``
has ``False`` as a value, than the previously generated code will not compile
and you will have to run code generator one more time.

Consider to explicitly set ``create_with_signature`` to ``True``. It will save
your and your users time in future.

.. code-block:: python

  mb = module_builder_t( ... )
  mb.calldefs().create_with_signature = True


------------------------
Overloading using macros
------------------------

`Boost.Python`_ provides two macros, which help you to deal with overloaded
functions:

* ``BOOST_PYTHON_FUNCTION_OVERLOADS``

* ``BOOST_PYTHON_MEMBER_FUNCTION_OVERLOADS``

`Boost.Python`_ tutorials contain an `explanation`_ about this macros.

.. _`explanation` : http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/functions.html#python.auto_overloading

You can instruct :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` to generate code, which will use the macros:

.. code-block:: python

  import module_builder

  mb = module_builder.module_builder_t( ... )
  x = mb.class_( "X" )
  x.member_functions( "f" ).use_overload_macro = True
  #-------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Member and free functions declaration classes have ``use_overload_macro`` property.
The default value of the property is ``False``.

You don't really have to use the macros, unless you have "registration order"
problem. The problem and work around described in :doc:`default arguments <default_args>` document.
