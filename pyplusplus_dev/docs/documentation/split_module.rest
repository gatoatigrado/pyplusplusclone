Splitting generated code to files
=================================

------------
Introduction
------------

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` provides 4 different strategies for splitting the generated code into files:

* single file

* multiple files

* fixed set of multiple files

* multiple files, where single class code is split to few files

-----------
Single file
-----------

If you just start with :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` or you are developing small module, than you should 
start with this strategy. It is simple - all source code generated to a single file.

Of course this solution has it's price - every time you change the code you will
have to recompile it. If you expose 2 or more declarations, this is annoying and 
time-consuming operation. In some cases you even will not be able to compile the
generated code, because of its size.


Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import module_builder
   
   mb = module_builder.module_builder_t(...)
   mb.build_code_creator( ... )
   mb.write_module( <<<file name>>> )

--------------
Multiple files
--------------

I believe this is the most widely used strategy. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` splits generated code 
as follows:

* every class has it's own source & header file
* the following declarations are split to separate source files:

  * named & unnamed enumerations

  * free functions

  * global variables
* "main" file - the file, which contains complete module registration

The main advantage of this mode is that you don't have to recompile the whole 
project if only single declaration was changed. Thus this mode suites well huge
projects.

There are few problems with this mode:

1. There are use cases, when the generated file name is too long. :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`
   uses class name as a basis for the file name. So in case of template
   instantiations the file name could be really long, very long.

2. This mode doesn't play nicely with IDEs. Every time you add/remove classes in
   your project the list of generated files will be changed. So, you will have
   to maintain your IDE environment file.

   This problem was addressed in "fixed set of multiple files" mode. Keep
   reading :-).

3. If your project has pretty big class, than it is possible that the generated
   code will be too big and it take huge amount of time to compile it (GCC) or
   even to fail to compile it (MSVC 7.1).

   This problem was addressed in "multiple files, where single class code is
   split to few files" mode.

Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import module_builder
   
   mb = module_builder.module_builder_t(...)
   mb.build_code_creator( ... )
   mb.split_module( <<<directory name>>> )


-------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple files, where single class code is split to few files
-------------------------------------------------------------

This mode solves the problem, I mentioned earlier - you have to expose huge class
and you have problems to compile generated code. 

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` will split huge class to files using the following strategy:

* every generated source file can contain maximum 20 exposed declarations
* the following declarations are split to separate source files:

  * enumerations

  * unnamed enumerations

  * classes

  * member functions

  * virtual member functions

  * pure virtual member functions

  * protected member functions  

* "main" class file - the file, which contains complete definition/registration
  of the generated file

Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import module_builder
   
   mb = module_builder.module_builder_t(...)
   mb.build_code_creator( ... )
   mb.split_module( <<<directory name>>>, [ <<<list of huge classes names>>> ] )

---------------------------
Fixed set of multiple files
---------------------------

This mode was born to play nicely with IDEs. It also can solve the problem with
long file names. The scheme used to name files doesn't use class name.

In this mode you define the number of generated source files for classes.


Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import module_builder
   
   mb = module_builder.module_builder_t(...)
   mb.build_code_creator( ... )
   mb.balanced_split_module( <<<directory name>>>, <<<number of generated source files>>> )


------------------
Precompiled header
------------------

Usage of precompiled header file reduces overall compilation time. Not all
compilers support the feature, moreover some of them can't handle presence of 
"boost/python.hpp" header in precompiled header file. 

:doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` doesn't provide user-friendly API to add/define precompiled header file
to the generated code. The main reason is that I don't have a good idea how to
integrate/add this functionality to :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>`. Nevertheless, you can enjoy from 
this time-saving feature:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyplusplus import module_builder
   from pyplusplus import code_creators
   
   mb = module_builder_t( ... )
   mb.build_code_creator( ... )

   precompiled_header = code_creators.include_t( 'your file name' )
   mb.code_creator.adopt_creator( precompiled_header, 0 )

   mb.split_module( ... )

API summary
-----------

Class ``module_builder_t`` contains 3 functions, related to file generation:

* 
  .. code-block:: python

     def write_module( file_name )

*  
  .. code-block:: python

     def split_module( self
                       , dir_name
                       , huge_classes=None
                       , on_unused_file_found=os.remove
                       , use_files_sum_repository=True)


  * ``dir_name`` - directory name the generated files will be put in
  * ``huge_classes`` - list of names of huge classes
  * ``on_unused_file_found`` - callable object, which is called every time
    :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` found that previously generated file is not in use anymore.
  * ``use_files_sum_repository``
    :doc:`Py++ <../pyplusplus>` is able to store md5 sum of the generated files in a file. Next 
    time you will generate code, Py++ will compare generated file content 
    against the sum, instead of loading the content of the previously generated
    file from the disk and comparing against it. 

    "<your module name>.md5.sum" is the file, that will be generated in the
    ``dir_name`` directory.

    Enabling this functionality should give you 10-15% of performance boost.

    Warning: If you changed manually some of the files - don't forget to delete
    the relevant line from "md5.sum" file. You can also delete the whole file. 
    If the file is missing, Py++ will use old plain method of comparing content 
    of the files. It will not re-write "unchanged" files and you will not be 
    forced to recompile the whole project.

                                , use_files_sum_repository=True)


  * ``number_of_files`` - the desired number of generated source files
