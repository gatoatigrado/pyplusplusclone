ctypes integration
==================

------------
Introduction
------------

`Boost.Python`_ is really a very powerful library, but if you are working
with code written in plain "C" - you've got a problem. You have to create
wrappers for almost every function or variable.

In general, if you want to work with plain "C" code from `Python`_
you don't have to create any wrapper - you can use `ctypes`_ package.

About ctypes
------------
`ctypes`_ is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C
compatible data types, and allows to call functions in dlls/shared
libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.

--------
The idea
--------

The idea behind "ctypes integration" functionality is really simple: you
configure :doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` to expose address of the variable\\return value, and than you
you use `ctypes`_ `from_address`_ functionality to access and modify the data.

Obviously, this approach has pros and cons:

* cons - it could be very dangerous - you can corrupt your application memory

* cons - managing memory is not something a typical `Python`_ user get used to.
  It is too "low level".

* pros - you don't need to create wrapper in C++

* pros - a Python user has access to the data

* pros - compilation time is smaller

* pros - you still can create wrapper, but using `Python`_


In my opinion, the better way to go is to "mix":

1. expose your native code using `Boost.Python`_ and "ctypes integration"
   functionality - it is easy and cheap

2. use `ctypes`_ module to access your data

3. create high level API in Python: the wrappers, which will ensure the
   constraints and will provide more "natural" interface

-------------------------
Implemented functionality
-------------------------

:doc:`Py++ <../../pyplusplus>` is able to

* expose global and member variable address

* expose "this" pointer value

* expose a class "sizeof"

* expose variable, which has a union type

* return address of return value as integer - :doc:`new call policy was created <../../documentation/functions/call_policies/return_addressof>`

   variables.rest
   this_and_sizeof.rest
   unions.rest

Future directions
-----------------

The functionality is going to be developed father and I intend to add
the following features:

* to port this functionality to 64bit systems

* to add ability to expose "C" functions without using `Boost.Python`_.
